/// into a gated tool body's own DI scope regardless of scoping. This matters because nested
/// <c>CreateAsyncScope()</c> calls are siblings, not children — they resolve the singleton
/// <c>IServiceScopeFactory</c> and root at the same root provider — so a scoped DI service resolved
/// inside a tool's own scope would be a *different instance* than one resolved in the filter. An
/// <c>AsyncLocal</c> has no such problem: it flows with the async call chain, not with the DI scope
/// tree. See <c>RbacIdentityFlowTests</c> for the test that proves this.
