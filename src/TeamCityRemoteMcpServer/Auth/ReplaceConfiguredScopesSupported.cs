/// Gives <see cref="McpAuthOptions.ScopesSupported"/> replace-instead-of-append semantics.
///
/// <c>ConfigurationBinder</c> appends to a collection that already holds items, so a bound
/// <c>McpAuth:ScopesSupported</c> can only ever *grow* past its C# default — measured, not assumed:
/// with a default of <c>[teamcity:read]</c>, binding <c>McpAuth:ScopesSupported:0=openid</c> yields
/// <c>[teamcity:read, openid]</c>. Switching the property to <c>string[]</c> does not help; arrays
/// append too, measured the same way.
///
/// That append is a live failure against an Okta *org* authorization server. The scopes a resource
/// server advertises in its RFC 9728 metadata are the scopes a conforming client then requests, so
/// a stray <c>teamcity:read</c> makes the authorization request fail wholesale with
/// <c>invalid_scope</c> — the org authorization server has no such scope and cannot be given one.
/// Deployments there must advertise exactly the OIDC scopes the tenant can actually grant.
///
/// Runs as a post-configure so it lands after the section bind. When the key is absent from
/// configuration the C# default is left untouched, which keeps the spec-conforming path byte-identical.
