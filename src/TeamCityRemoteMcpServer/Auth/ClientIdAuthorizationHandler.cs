/// <summary>
/// Resolves <see cref="McpAuthOptions"/> from DI at evaluation time rather than reading config into
/// the policy lambda at registration time — the same reasoning as
/// <see cref="ConfigureJwtBearerOptions"/>. A policy lambda cannot see the service provider, so an
/// eagerly-captured allowlist would also make ValidateOnStart decorative.
///
/// An empty allowlist means "no client check", not "deny everything". That is safe only because
/// <see cref="McpAuthOptionsValidator"/> refuses to start the app when the allowlist is empty *and*
/// <see cref="McpAuthOptions.ValidateAudience"/> is false, so the dangerous pair — no audience
/// binding and no client binding — is unreachable at runtime. Once a non-empty allowlist is
/// configured, this handler fails closed: a missing `cid` claim is a denial, not a pass.
